# Landmark Detection using tensorlow 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`landmarkdetection.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to train and evaluate a deep learning model for **landmark detection** using TensorFlow and Keras. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation, along with visualization of results.

## Features

* Image loading and preprocessing with OpenCV and Pillow
* Label encoding and dataset preparation with Pandas and scikit-learn
* Deep learning model creation with TensorFlow/Keras
* Training and evaluation pipeline
* Saving and loading models with Joblib
* Visualization of images and training metrics

## Requirements

Install the following dependencies before running the notebook:

* Python 3.8+
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* OpenCV
* Pillow
* Joblib

You can install them with:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python pillow joblib
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/landmark-detection.git
   cd landmark-detection
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook landmarkdetection.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, build the model, and train it.
